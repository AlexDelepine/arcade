<h2 id="goal-and-motivation">Goal and Motivation</h2>
<p>The information included within our epics are high level business objectives and does not always leave much room for practical information. Sometime the v-team is able to capture all the information listed within outlined below in the epic. If that is the case, there is no need for an additional document.</p>
<p>In most cases, however, v-teams need a place where they can capture additional information that helps them &quot;think about&quot; how they are going to implement a given feature.</p>
<p>The goal of the one-pager is to bring clarity to how the v-team is going to implement and support specific aspects of the business goals defined in the epic.</p>
<p>The document below is meant to be a guideline on what the v-team should be thinking about when defining the feature they are working on. It is up to you what you include in your one pager.</p>
<h2 id="one-pager-guidelines">One-Pager Guidelines</h2>
<p>In this section you will find the areas that you should consider including in your one-pager.</p>
<h3 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h3>
<p>Who is this work for (i.e. stakeholder and those that should &quot;sign-off&quot; on your POC) and what are the problem(s) they asking us to solve?</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-concept-poc">Proof of Concept (POC)</h3>
<p>An effective proof of concept proves the goal of a proposed project is viable, and will be successful. The value of a POC is it can help the v-team identify gaps in processes that might interfere with success.</p>
<p>A POC can help</p>
<ul>
<li>Elicits feedback from everyone involved in a project, including those who might not have otherwise contributed, thereby mitigating unforeseen risk.</li>
<li>Creates a test project to evaluate before work begins on an actual project.</li>
<li>Verifies that concepts and theories applied to a project will have a real-world application.</li>
<li>Helps us to prove our assumptions (for example, if certain functionality, like using a service account to post comments from GitHub to Teams in a service, is possible) before committing to completing the work in a given timeframe.</li>
<li>Helps us to adjust our expectations about how much work a feature might take to complete depending on the challenges we run into that we didn't originally consider in our assumptions.</li>
<li>Can have more than one POC, if necessary, for a project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Will the new implementation of any existing functionality cause breaking changes for existing consumers?</li>
<li>What are your assumptions?</li>
<li>What are your unknowns?</li>
<li>What dependencies will this epic/feature(s) have?
<ul>
<li>Are the dependencies currently in a state that the functionality in the epic can consume them now, or will they need to be updated?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a goal to have this work completed by, and what is the risk of not hitting that date? (e.g. missed OKRs, increased pain-points for consumers, functionality is required for the next product release, et cetera)</li>
<li>Does anything the new feature depend on consume a limited/throttled API resource?</li>
<li>Have you estimated what maximum usage is?</li>
<li>Are you utilizing any response data that allows intelligent back-off from the service?</li>
<li>What is the plan for getting more capacity if the feature both must exist and needs more capacity than available?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage-telemetry">Usage Telemetry</h3>
<ul>
<li>How are we measuring the “usefulness” to the stakeholders of the business objectives?</li>
<li>How are we tracking the usage of this new feature?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-ability-of-feature">Service-ability of Feature</h2>
<p>Changes that we implement often require addition maintenance to support them long term. The FR group has been set up to handle this work but it is up to the v-team to make sure FR is successful in servicing the changes made within your epic long term. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/Project-Docs/Servicing%20Guidelines.md">Servicing Guidelines</a> Document for what you should be thinking about during your feature creation to help the team be able to easily service your feature long term.</p>
<h2 id="house-keeping">House Keeping</h2>
<p>In order to align with Epic Content Guidance, one-pagers should be stored in a central location.</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder to store your One-Pager can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/tree/main/Documentation/TeamProcess/One-Pagers">Documentation Folder</a></li>
<li>The name the one-pager should contain the name of the epic and the epic issue number (for easy reference).
<ul>
<li>Example: Coordinate migration from &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot; in all dotnet org repos - core-eng10412.md.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the PR process to document the discussion around the content of the one-pager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidance for Epics can be found at <a href="https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_wiki/wikis/DNCEng%20Services%20Wiki/552/Guidelines-for-Epics">Guidelines for Epics</a> wiki.</p>
<p>After all discussions have been resolved, the resulting one-pager document should be signed-off (this does not need to be a formal process) by stakeholders (e.g. v-team members, epic owners, et cetera) and then linked to the associated epic's GitHub issue for discover-ability.</p>
