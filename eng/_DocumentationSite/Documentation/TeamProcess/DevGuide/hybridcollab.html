<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Recognize that coming into work does not necessarily imply coding. Rather, coming into socialize and collaborate in person is very important in itself.</p>
<p>As we experiment and experience the realities of hybrid, many of you are noticing what research is also showing – namely that solid work relationships are very important, and that hybrid/remote work can have a negative effect on those relationships.</p>
<p>Given this, we agree to <strong>designate one day a week where everyone in Redmond agrees to make best effort to come into the office for the express purpose of collaborating and socializing with the rest of the team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agreement Specifics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will each do our reasonable best to be present each Thursday from 11am to 2pm for the express purpose of interacting with others, collaborating, chatting, and otherwise connecting - often informally - with our co-workers.</li>
<li>No coding is expected during this time.  (of course, it's alright to code too...)</li>
<li>When on First Responder, taking care of our customers takes priority.</li>
<li>It is understood that some are remote, and we should continue to be intentionally inclusive for those as well wherever and however possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Relationships are an important and necessary part of our work here at Microsoft and should be prioritized as such.</li>
<li>Relationships are easier to maintain and build on when there's consistent face-to-face interactions where possible.</li>
<li>Social/collaborative interactions with our co-workers should be prioritized as an important part of our job - e.g. work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
<p>Research is showing more and more that social interactions are more of a &quot;must have&quot; than a &quot;nice to have&quot;.  In a recent write up from Microsoft Research (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid-work-work">Great Expectations: Making Hybrid Work Work</a>), there are some interesting quotes in section 5 of the report.</p>
<p><em>One of the most felt aspects of remote and hybrid work is the impact it's had on our relationships. <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work"><em>Last year's Work Trend Index</em></a></em> revealed that teams became more siloed, and this year's study shows the trend one year later.</em></p>
<p><em>When people trust one another and have [social] capital, you get a willingness to take risks, you get more innovation and creativity and less groupthink - Nancy Baym, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research</em></p>
<p><em>When work-life balance is out of whack, most people cut out relationship-building for more urgent matters,&quot; says Constance Noonan Hadley, an organizational psychologist who studies workplace relationships. &quot;Regardless of remote status, building relationships will still feel like a luxury workers cannot afford unless there is a shift in how time is prioritized and valued by managers</em></p>
