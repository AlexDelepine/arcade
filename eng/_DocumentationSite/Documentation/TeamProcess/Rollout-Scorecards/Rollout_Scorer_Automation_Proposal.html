<p>The <a href="/MiscTools/RolloutScorer/Readme.md">Rollout Scorer</a> as it exists now is very useful for speeding up the process
of scoring our rollouts. However, it could still be made more valuable by fully automating it as a service that requires
minimal human intervention.</p>
<h2 id="defining-and-automating-the-remaining-metrics">Defining and automating the remaining metrics</h2>
<p>Currently, the rollout scorer is capable of automatically calculating the total rollout duration, number of critical issues,
number of hotfixes, and number of rollbacks from build timelines and labeled core-eng issues. However, it still relies on
manual input to determine downtime and rollout failure.</p>
<h3 id="rollout-failure">Rollout failure</h3>
<p>Rollout failure is a boolean value, and failed rollouts gain an extra fifty points. In the past, we have defined rollout
failure as &quot;we sent out release notes for a rollout and then did not perform a rollout at all.&quot; Thus, the only rollout
previously categorized as a failure was the <a href="Scorecard_2019-09-04.html">4 September 2019 OSOB rollout</a>. Under this definition,
rollout failure requires manual categorization since there is definitionally no evidence that a rollout was attempted.</p>
<p>However, a more robust definition of rollout failure is &quot;we did not roll out everything we promised in the release notes.&quot;
This still encompasses the previous definition, but additionally encompasses rollouts with partially successful deployments.
Anecdotally, both of the previous OSOB rollouts at time of writing fall under this definition, while there has only been one
rollout since we started tracking these that meets the earlier definition.</p>
<p>This definition also has the benefit that it is significantly easier to measure –
<strong>if the final build of a rollout isnot green, the rollout is categorized as a failed deployment.</strong></p>
<h3 id="downtime">Downtime</h3>
<p>Part of the reason downtime relied on manual input was that the definition itself is incredibly nebulous.
The <a href="README.html">Rollout Scorecard's readme</a> notes that downtime includes both &quot;availability and reliability.&quot;</p>
<p>The telemetry epic folks are expecting roll out alerting for our availability metrics for Helix and Maestro
(which should cover arcade-services measurements); these metrics are already measured <a href="https://dotnet-eng-grafana.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/d/quNLOchZz/service-availability?orgId=2&amp;refresh=30s">here</a>.
The next step should be to add alerting on metrics for reliability. Adding this alerting is outside the scope of this project, but some proposals for how it could be done are included below.</p>
<details>
<summary>Alerting suggestions</summary>
<br>
To begin with, we should start with an extremely broad definition of reliability downtime to capture the most catastrophic failures.
To this end, I propose the following alerting queries:
<ul>
<li>To measure OSOB downtime, look back over the past thirty five minutes and compare the queue depth to started jobs across all queues.</li>
<li><strong>If there are more than an arbitrary number of queued jobs (e.g. 100) and zero started jobs, OSOB should be considered &quot;down&quot; and an alert will be triggered.</strong></li>
<li>To measure Helix downtime, we will measure the status of the controller with the same query structure but compare service bus queue depth</li>
<li>to queued jobs across all queues.</li>
<li><strong>If service bus queue depth is greater than zero and there are zero queued jobs, Helix should be considered &quot;down&quot; and an alert will be triggered.</strong></li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Once alerting is in place, alerts will be filed as GitHub issues in core-eng. The Rollout Scorer is already pointed at core-eng for issues,
hotfixes, and rollbacks, and thus we can use these issues to determine downtime as well. Issues from these alerts can be automatically
tagged with a <em>Rollout Downtime</em> label and the appropriate repo rollout label. The Rollout Scorer will then measure downtime as
<strong>the finish time of the build that ran prior to the opening of the alert to the time the issue is closed.</strong> We could also use a different
event to indicate the end of a downtime period, such as leaving a comment on the issue saying &quot;Downtime resolved at [time]&quot; or something similar.
This has the additional benefit of allowing downtime issues to be manually filed if necessary, similar to the manual hotfix/rollout issues we already have.</p>
<h2 id="azure-function-and-build-triggers">Azure Function and Build Triggers</h2>
<p>The existing Rollout Scorer will be moved to arcade-services and deployed as an Azure Function.</p>
<ol>
<li>The function will poll the deployment table (see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-services/pull/814">dotnet/arcade-services#814</a>) for new entries</li>
<li>Upon finding a new deployment, it will set a timer for two days to allow a buffer for the rollout to complete fully. (This timer could be revised to a day if our rollout periods shorten.</li>
<li>As further entries come in (from other rollouts in the same period of time including both hotfixes and other repos), the timer will be reset and collect a list of repos to score.</li>
<li>Once the timer hits zero, the rollout scorer will score all the repos it received requests from with the start date set to the first day it received a request. As at present, it will create a PR to core-eng and add the scores to the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will effectively fully automate the rollout scorecard creation process.</p>
