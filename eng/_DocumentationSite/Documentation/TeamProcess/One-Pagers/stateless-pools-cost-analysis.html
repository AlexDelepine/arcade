<h1 id="stateless-pools---a-cost-analysis">Stateless Pools - A Cost Analysis</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>In order to determine the costs of switching from stateful pools to stateless ones, the following study was conducted.
Switching to stateless pools will resolve bug <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core-eng/issues/14683">dotnet/core-eng#14683</a>, which
involves machines running out of disk space due to multiple runs on the same machine. 1ES has informed us that the working
directories on stateful machines will not be cleaned between runs and that we should switch to stateless pools in order to
avoid this problem.</p>
<h1 id="time-cost">Time Cost</h1>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>Three pipelines were examined as part of this study: runtime (ID 686), runtime-dev-innerloop (ID 700), and runtime-staging (ID 924).
These particular pipelines were picked because they could all be triggered via a single runtime PR.
To determine a baseline for the stateful 1ES pools, runs between 8 Oct 2021 and 22 Oct 2021 in the TimelineBuilds table in Kusto were queried.
Specifically, this this study only concerned itself with runs which met the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Successful</em>: in order to make sure builds were as similar as possible, all failing runs were excluded from the results</li>
<li><em>Main</em>: once again for the purpose of consistency, only runs targeting the <code>main</code> branch were used</li>
<li><em>Inlier</em>: builds which took longer than five hours to complete were excluded from the dataset in interest of eliminating outliers</li>
</ul>
<p>To acquire the data for the stateless pool, 10 runs of these pipelines were triggered manually targeting the
NetCore-Public-Int pool, which was manually set to be stateless and capable of scaling out to 300 machines.
The sample size for these runs is necessarily much smaller than the baseline due to time constraints. The runs were
triggered on 22 Oct 2021 and 25 Oct 2021.</p>
<p>BuildIds of stateless runs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>runtime: <code>(1436605, 1436874, 1437134, 1439516, 1439517, 1439738, 1439739, 1439773, 1439774, 1439775)</code></li>
<li>runtime-dev-innerloop: <code>(1436606, 1436862, 1437004, 1437087, 1439512, 1439618, 1439703, 1439745, 1439776, 1439777)</code></li>
<li>runtime-staging: <code>(1436608, 1436875, 1437086, 1439514, 1439545, 1439779, 1439781, 1439782, 1439783, 1439784)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caveats-and-limitations">Caveats and Limitations</h3>
<p>A few notable differences exist between our two samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sample size differs massively. A large sample size can be obtained for the baseline and it was, but the smaller sample
size for the delta inherently makes conclusions from that data less reliable.</li>
<li>The baseline data, while having a large sample size, contains runs over many different commits. While they are likely
still similar enough to be useful for analysis, this differs from the delta data which contains runs over only a single
commit.</li>
<li>While many different jobs were being run all at once during the delta data, this still does not reflect realistic usage
in prod.</li>
<li>Not every run in the delta data was 100% successful -- while none presented a catastrophic failure, several had minor
failures due to test flakiness.</li>
<li>This study still only reflects the usage of one (albeit very large) repo.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>While it is difficult to fully attribute one hundred percent of the build time increases to the stateless pools (especially with the delta
data having a larger standard deviation in the runtime job start data and both the runtime-staging data sets), there is still a marked
increase in both the build time and the job queue time for all observed pipelines.</p>
<p>Of particular note is the runtime-dev-innerloop pipeline, which has very tight data sets for both the baseline and the delta. With lower
standard deviations for both builds and jobs, we saw mean build time increase by five minutes and mean job start time increase by
<strong>nearly eight minutes</strong>. In worst-case scenario runs, such an increase would translate to very high increases in overall build time,
which may be what is reflected in the runtime and runtime-staging mean build time increases.</p>
<p>Given this data, it is the opinion of the author that stateless pools do not represent a reasonable alternative to stateful pools with
workspace cleanup.</p>
